# First Post: Why Did I Even Make This Website?

Hello world 👋  
(Yes, *that* "hello world" every coder abuses for 10+ years straight.)

This is my very first post here. Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I just thought,  
*"hmmm let's waste 3 hours styling a website and call it 'productive'."* 🫡

I mean, other people out there are building billion-dollar startups.  
Meanwhile, I spent two weeks fighting with TailwindCSS margins 😔.

## What to expect from this website?

- ✍️ Random blogs about random tech stuff I barely understand
- 🧠 Brain dumps at 3AM when my two brain cells collide
- 🛠️ Cool projects that **almost** work
- 🤡 And of course, occasional memes because... sanity

## So... why did I suddenly make a website?

**Funny story.**  
I was randomly doomscrolling through GitHub's explore tab like every normal human being 💀.  
And somehow I stumbled across this insane repo: [puang59/puang](https://github.com/puang59/puang).

My two brain cells had a meeting right there and decided:  
> "Bro. You NEED a personal website. Right. Now."

And just like that, here we are.  
Blame the repo. Blame my ADHD. Blame society. Whatever works.

## Final thoughts

If you somehow found this website:  
**Congratulations.** You have unlocked a secret corner of the internet nobody asked for.

Stay tuned. Or don’t.  
Either way, I’m still gonna keep posting nonsense here 💀🙏.
